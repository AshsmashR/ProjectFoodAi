# ProjectFoodAi
Inspired by paid calorie-tracking apps, I built a lightweight CNN for multi-class food classification using a Kaggle dataset. I preprocessed data, created a calorie mapping CSV, and optimized the model for limited computational power. Future plans include adding reinforcement learning and a UI to make the system more interactive and user-friendly.
